    -message: "🚨 COLLECTION SUCCESS MODAL TESTING BLOCKED - SESSION MANAGEMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Attempted comprehensive testing of the new Collection Success Modal functionality as requested in review, but encountered critical session management issues that prevented complete testing. ✅ AUTHENTICATION SUCCESS: Successfully logged in as Muhasebe user (sukb/Sukran2024!) with proper user context verification showing 'Şükran Bucak' and 'Muhasebe' department. ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE: Session repeatedly expired during navigation attempts, causing redirects back to login page and preventing access to the Collection Form needed for success modal testing. This session timeout/persistence issue blocks the ability to test the complete workflow: login → navigate to form → fill form → submit → test success modal. 🔍 SUCCESS MODAL IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED: Code review of NewCollectionForm.jsx confirms the success modal is properly implemented with all required elements: 1) Green checkmark icon in circular background (.bg-green-100 svg) 2) Success title 'Tahsilat Başarıyla Kaydedildi!' 3) Collection details section with Tahsilat No, Müşteri/Tedarikçi, Tarih, Tutar fields 4) Receipt notification with blue info box 'Tahsilat makbuzu otomatik olarak e-posta ile gönderildi' 5) Action buttons: Green 'Tamam' button and 'Yeni Tahsilat' button with proper functionality 📋 URGENT RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate and resolve session management/authentication persistence issues to enable proper testing of the Collection Success Modal functionality. The modal implementation appears complete but requires functional testing in a stable session environment."
