The trajectory details an intensive, iterative development process focused on enhancing a CRM application for a Turkish-speaking user. All future communication must be in **Turkish**.

The work began by debugging and completing a Phone Codes management module, fixing data mismatches between the FastAPI backend and React frontend, and cleaning up duplicate code. This involved re-seeding the database and correcting Pydantic models.

The main effort then shifted to a new Convention Center module. The initial implementation was misunderstood, leading to a complete refactor. The user first requested a simple bulk-import tool, which was built. Subsequently, the user provided massive datasets of convention centers across the globe (USA, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania), which were imported via the bulk-import endpoint. Following the data import, the user requested a sophisticated, three-panel UI (Country -> City -> Center) with statistics and filters, leading to another major rewrite of the  component.

The final phase involved extensive enhancements to the , including making fields optional, adding new dynamic dropdowns (Projede Rolü, Kaynak, Durum) with + Yeni Ekle modals, and adding Cinsiyet and Doğum Günü fields. This phase also included debugging a complex issue where phone codes didn't update correctly based on the selected country, which required creating a large mapping object. The most recent task was a request to improve the realism of the Fill Test Data button.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive CRM tool designed for dynamic data management. The core requirement is to empower users to manage business-critical data directly from the UI, eliminating hard-coded values.

**1. Library Module:** A central Library in the settings area serves as the hub for all dynamic data.
    - **Phone Codes:** A fully functional CRUD module for managing international phone codes, seeded with initial data.
    - **Convention Centers:** A global database of convention centers. The user must be able to import data in bulk () and manage it through a three-panel UI (Country > City > Center) with statistics, search, and filter capabilities. The system now contains over 580 centers across 95 countries.

**2. New Customer Form:** The New Customer creation form must be highly detailed and customizable.
    - **Required Fields:** The form logic was updated to make Company Mobile Phone and Contact Person Address optional.
    - **Field Renaming:** The Services field was renamed to Ürün ve Servisler (Products and Services).
    - **New Contact Fields:** For each contact person, new fields were added: Doğum Günü (Birthday, optional), Cinsiyet (Gender, dropdown), and a Projede Rolü (Project Role) dynamic dropdown with a modal to add new roles.
    - **New Category Fields:** Two new dynamic dropdown fields, Kaynak (Source) and Durum (Status), were added to the main customer category section, both with modals for adding new options.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pydantic for data validation.
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS,  for icons, .
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Architecture:** Monorepo (React/FastAPI).
- **Core Patterns:**
    - API-driven data seeding and re-seeding.
    - Bulk import endpoints for CSV-like data.
    - Dynamic, searchable dropdown components with Add New modals.
    - UI state management to prevent duplicate submissions ().
    - Extensive client-side mapping to resolve data inconsistencies (e.g., Turkish country names to  country codes).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core FastAPI application containing all API endpoints and business logic.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was heavily modified. Duplicate  models and endpoints were found and removed. A data mismatch between the DB schema and Pydantic models was resolved by correcting the  GET endpoint. A  parameter was added to an initialization endpoint to allow re-seeding. A complete set of CRUD and bulk-import endpoints () was created. A check to prevent duplicate phone code creation was added to the POST endpoint.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The primary form for data entry, making it a critical user-facing component.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file received the most extensive updates.
        -   **Validation Removal:** Required flags and validation logic were removed for  and the contact's .
        -   **New State & Fields:** State was added for , , and . Corresponding UI for Doğum Günü (Birthday), Cinsiyet (Gender), Projede Rolü (Project Role), Kaynak (Source), and Durum (Status) was implemented, including dynamic  dropdowns with modals to add new options.
        -   **Phone Code Fix:** A large mapping object was added to the  helper function to correctly map Turkish country names to the  library's two-letter country codes, fixing a major bug where phone codes would not update.
        -   **Test Data Function:** The  function was updated to populate all the newly added fields.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The UI for the new Convention Center module.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This component underwent a full-scale redesign. It was initially a simple import tool. It was then completely rewritten into a sophisticated three-panel layout (Countries > Cities > Centers) inspired by . This new version includes statistic cards at the top (Total Centers, Countries, Cities), search/filter functionality, and a multi-column list view for a professional user experience. A CSS fix (, ) was added to prevent long names from breaking the layout.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages the phone codes library.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** To fix a duplicate entry bug, an  state was added to disable the Add and Save buttons during API calls, preventing users from clicking multiple times. A frontend check was also added to see if a code already exists before attempting to add it.

<pending_tasks>
- **Enhance Test Data Generation:** The user has requested that the Test Verisi Doldur (Fill Test Data) button in  be updated to generate more realistic and varied data. This includes more believable company names, titles, and ensuring that a different country/city is selected each time, along with adding tags.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate previous task was a series of significant enhancements to the . The user requested four main changes:
1.  Make Company Mobile Phone and Contact Address non-mandatory.
2.  Rename the Services label to Ürün ve Servisler.
3.  Add an optional Birthday field for contacts.
4.  Add Gender and Project Role dropdowns for contacts.
5.  Add Source and Status dropdowns for the customer.
6.  Update the Fill Test Data button to include these new fields.

All of these points were addressed. The validation was removed, labels were changed, and the new stateful fields and dynamic dropdowns (with modals for adding new options) were implemented. The test data function was also updated.

Immediately after confirming these changes were done, the user made a follow-up request to improve the quality of the generated test data.

**The last action taken by the AI was acknowledging this final request.** The AI was about to start modifying the  function inside  to make the generated data more realistic.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Modify the  function in  to generate more realistic data, as requested. This will involve creating more varied fake data for company names, randomly selecting from the full list of countries/cities, and adding tags.
