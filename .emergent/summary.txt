The trajectory documents a rapid, feature-rich development sprint focused on building the public-facing and administrative layers of the Vitingo CRM application. The user, whose primary language is Turkish, directed the AI engineer to pivot from bug fixing to creating a new SaaS landing page, a sign-up/pricing page, and a comprehensive Ultra Admin panel.

The development process was highly iterative. The engineer first scaffolded the entire landing page, creating separate React components for each section (Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Footer) and adding a top navigation bar, closely following user-provided visual examples. A Get Started page was then built for user registration, which required several loops of feedback to correctly implement the pricing logic for monthly vs. annual billing with a 20% discount.

The most substantial part of the work was the creation of the Ultra Admin panel. This involved building a new layout and, critically, a Library module to manage master data. This required significant backend work: creating new Pydantic models and RESTful API endpoints in FastAPI for Countries, Cities, Currencies, Fair Centers, and Phone Codes. A Python script () was created to populate the MongoDB database with extensive initial data provided by the user. The frontend was then built with CRUD interfaces for each data type. Debugging involved fixing Pydantic validation errors caused by model name conflicts and ensuring frontend components correctly parsed the API responses. The final user request was to update the phone code and currency data with new, more extensive lists.

The next agent must respond in Turkish.

<product_requirements>
The product is a comprehensive CRM application. The work summarized here focused on building out the public-facing and administrative functionalities required for a SaaS offering.

**Implemented Features:**
1.  **SaaS Landing Page ():** A professional, multi-section marketing page inspired by a user-provided example, featuring a hero section, features list, dynamic pricing table, testimonials, and FAQ.
2.  **Get Started Page ():** A registration and plan selection page with four tiers (including a free trial). It features a toggle for monthly/annual pricing, correctly calculating a 20% discount for annual payments and displaying the total yearly cost.
3.  **Ultra Admin Panel ():** A dedicated administrative interface with a distinct design. It includes a dashboard and a Library module.
4.  **Master Data Library:** A core feature within the Ultra Admin panel for managing master data. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for:
    *   Countries (189 seeded)
    *   Cities (26 seeded)
    *   Currencies (155+ seeded with flags)
    *   Fair Centers (1 seeded)
    *   Phone Codes (150+ seeded)
5.  **Login Flow:** The main CRM login page () was integrated into the landing page's navigation. For development ease, the password requirement was temporarily removed.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React (Hooks: , ), React Router, Tailwind CSS for styling, Component-based architecture.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Pydantic models,  for modularity).
- **Database:** MongoDB, accessed asynchronously. A Python script () was created and used to perform initial data population.
- **Architecture:** Monorepo structure. A significant architectural addition is the Library system, which centralizes master data management via dedicated backend APIs and a separate admin UI.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The latest work heavily expanded both, particularly by adding new routes and components for the landing page and admin panel.



- ****
    - **Importance**: Main FastAPI application file. It defines all API routes and Pydantic models.
    - **Changes**: Massively expanded to support the Library feature. New Pydantic models (, , , etc.) and dozens of new API endpoints for full CRUD operations on each library entity were added. A Pydantic validation bug was fixed by renaming a conflicting  model to .

- ** (New File)**
    - **Importance**: A critical script for populating the MongoDB database with initial master data for the Library.
    - **Changes**: Created from scratch. It connects to the database and populates the , , , , and  collections with extensive data provided by the user. It was updated multiple times to add more data and new fields (like flags for currencies).

- ** (New Components)**
    - **Importance**: This new directory and its sub-components form the entire public-facing website.
    - **Files**:  assembles the marketing page.  handles user registration and plan selection.  is the entry point for the admin panel.  contains the CRUD pages for master data.
    - **Changes**: All files were created from scratch.  and  underwent multiple revisions to fix the annual pricing calculation logic based on user feedback. The  components were built to fetch data from the new backend endpoints and display it in tables with edit/delete functionality.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The user login page for the main CRM.
    - **Changes**: The login logic in  was modified to remove the password check, allowing login with only a username for development purposes. A Home Page button linking to  was added. Redirection logic using  was added to ensure users are sent to the dashboard upon successful login.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The root component that defines all application routes.
    - **Changes**: New routes were added for , , , and  to make the new pages accessible.

<pending_tasks>
- **Integrate Library Data into CRM Forms:** The primary pending task is to update the existing CRM forms (e.g., New Project Form, New Fair Form) to fetch data for dropdown menus (like Country and City) from the newly created Library API endpoints, as explicitly requested by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was a comprehensive update of the Library data, specifically for **Currencies** and **Phone Codes**, based on extensive new lists provided by the user.

1.  **Currencies Update:** The user provided a list of ~155 currencies with their corresponding flag emojis.
    *   **Backend:** The  Pydantic model in  was updated to include a  field.
    *   **Data:** The  script was updated with the full new list of currencies.
    *   **Frontend:** The  component was modified to display the new  column in the table.

2.  **Phone Codes Update:** The user requested to replace the old phone code list with a new, larger one.
    *   **Backend:** The  model was updated in .
    *   **Data:** The  script was updated to clear the old phone codes and insert the new list. The script was executed successfully.
    *   **Frontend:** The corresponding  was updated to display the new data format.

The engineer's very last actions were to run the updated seed script, restart the backend server to apply the changes, and was about to begin testing the frontend to verify that the new data for both currencies and phone codes is displayed correctly in the Ultra Admin panel.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend at  to confirm that the updated Para Birimleri (Currencies) and Telefon Kodları (Phone Codes) tabs correctly display the new, comprehensive data seeded in the last step.
