The AI engineer continued developing the Vitingo CRM, focusing on expanding UI functionality based on detailed user requests. The iterative process involved implementing new dashboard menus and associated pages, primarily using mock data for frontend validation. Key steps included integrating User Management action buttons (view, edit, more actions), adding new Müşteri Aday (Customer Prospect) and Teklifler (Quotes) menus, and populating Satış Fırsatları (Sales Opportunities) sub-pages with structured mock tables. Debugging involved resolving UI rendering issues for action buttons and addressing user feedback on page formatting. Most recently, the engineer worked on a Müşteriler (Customers) menu, creating mock data, a new customer form, and associated list pages. The immediate task is to fix the integration of the Yeni Müşteri form in .

The user requested a user-friendly Vitingo CRM with colorful graphics. Initially, a frontend MVP was built with mock data for a dashboard, charts, and activity feed.

Subsequent requests included:
1.  **Sales Opportunities**: Expanding the existing Satış Fırsatları menu into a dropdown with Yeni Satış Fırsatı, Tüm Satış Fırsatları, Açık Fırsatlar, Kazanılan Fırsatlar, Kaybedilen Fırsatlar, and Favori Fırsatlar. The user explicitly requested all these sub-pages to have a consistent table format, similar to the original Açık Fırsatlar page, each populated with at least 10 example rows of relevant mock data.
2.  **User Management**: Implementing a Kullanıcı Yönetimi menu with Yeni Kullanıcı, Tüm Kullanıcılar, Pasif Kullanıcılar, and Önceki Kullanıcılar sub-menus. The Tüm Kullanıcılar page needed action buttons (view, edit, more actions with Sil, Paylaş, Mesaj, Mail) via modals/popovers. The Yeni Kullanıcı form requires auto-generated username/password, mandatory fields (Ad, Soyad, E-posta), optional fields (Telefon, Doğum Tarihi), and department selection.
3.  **Customer Prospect Management**: Adding a Müşteri Aday menu above Satış Fırsatları with Yeni Müşteri Adayı and Müşteri Adayları sub-menus.
4.  **Quotes Management**: Adding a Teklifler menu below Satış Fırsatları with Yeni Teklif and Tüm Teklifler sub-menus.
5.  **Customer Management**: Adding a Müşteriler menu, converting it to a dropdown with Yeni Müşteri, Tüm Müşteriler, Pasif Müşteriler, and Favori Müşteriler. Yeni Müşteri needs a form (screenshot provided), while the other three should be table views with at least 10 example customers, using the Tüm satış fırsatları table logic and Yeni müşteri oluşturma data.
